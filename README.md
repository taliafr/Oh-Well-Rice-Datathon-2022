### A predictive analysis of rate of penetration as a function of drilling parameters of offshore wells

#### Overview
Offshore drilling can be a time-, labor-, and resource- intensive endeavor. Investment into new underwater rigs poses unique challenges to financiers, as tens of thousands of feet and rock must be displaced before acquisition of the precious oil. Luckily, insight gleaned from careful analysis of empirical data can minimize cost, ultimately maximizing profit and ensuring a competitive market position for the data fluent. Here, we attempt to model the role of controllable and preexisting drilling parameters in determining the rate of penetration in drill sites. With this model, we hope to assist in the creation of of the ultimate ‘Drilling Roadmap’,
